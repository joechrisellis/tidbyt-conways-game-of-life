# Conway's Game of Life for Tidbyt
Conway's Game of Life for Tidbyt display, written in Starlark

I don't have my [Tidbyt](https://tidbyt.com/) display yet so I don't know how well this will work on the hardware, but it works in the Pixlet emulator.

## Quick start
1. Install [`pixlet`](https://github.com/tidbyt/pixlet)
2. Run `pixlet serve life.star`
3. Go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
